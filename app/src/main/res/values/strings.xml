        My Wallet is an app that helps you keep track of who owes money to you and who you owe money to. Did you split an Uber or Lyft with a friend and need
        to pay them back? Perhaps you helped another friend with a concert ticket until they get paid. With My Wallet these transactions will stay at the
        top of your mind.
